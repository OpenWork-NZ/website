  <h1>OpenWork Limited</h1>
  <p><em>A nicer website is on the way.</em></p>
  <p>OpenWork designs solutions that enable you to find, link, and share
    information in ways that work for you. We provide system design,
    implementation and development with Geospatial Technologies, Linked Open
    Data, and Online Catalogue Systems. We work closely with international and
    regional standards organisations to ensure that the solutions we provide
    are open, robust and sustainable.</p>

  <h2>Focus areas</h2>
  <h3>Geospatial information</h3>
  <p>Location is the primary means by which things are related, in that nearer
    things tend to be more related to each other than further things. We provide
    our geospatial expertise to help you pick up on these relations.</p>

  <h3>Linked Open Data</h3>
  <p>Aggregating information from multiple sources can be a pain. A pain that
    Linked Data, a set of open standards from the W3C, reduces significantly.</p>
  <p>It does this by recording the links between things, allowing different
    parties to explicitly reference the same concepts, and by applying
    "inference" to determine when they're implicitly refering to the same
    concepts.</p>

  <h3>Online Catalogues</h3>
  <p>Before you can use data, you need to know that it exists. And that it is
    of sufficient quality for use. This is what catalogues help you with.</p>
  <p>Catalogues also help Linked Open Data, because they help different parties
    refer to the same things the same way.</p>

    since he was 10, Adrian Cochrane is passionate about helping people be
    empowered by computers through custom software development work. His hobbies
    include development of a web browser for his favourite operating system
    (elementary OS), an illustration of the fundamentals of programming for
    laypeople, and an exploration of how web browsers could be more secure and
    work for more people. Itâ€™s not enough for Adrian to create something that
    works - he must know why it works!</p>
